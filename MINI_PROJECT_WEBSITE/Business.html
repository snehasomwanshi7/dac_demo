<p>Business is a unique setting because often you’re trying to motivate yourself as well as those around you. Sometimes, you’re trying to motivate others even more than yourself. 
To help you achieve maximum motivation and productivity for you and your team, it’s important to consider the following types of motivation.
<h1>Types of Motivation in Business:</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>Attitude Motivation</dt>
  <dd>- Attitude motivation refers to the type of motivation that’s cultivated through the desire to change the way you or other people think and feel. While it has some similarities to the externally-focused social motivation below, people who are motivated by attitude engage in actions and interactions with the express intent of making themselves and the 
people around them feel better in a positive and uplifting way.
For example, if you’re motivated to work for a non-profit or volunteer in a soup kitchen because making people feel good makes you feel good, you’re motivated by a change in attitude. Similarly, if you’re a manager at a company and you get joy out of helping your direct reports grow and succeed, you’re also taking part in attitude motivation.</dd>
  
<dt>Achievement Motivation</dt>
  <dd>- 
Achievement motivation states that people are driven by the desire to pursue and achieve specific goals. People who are driven by this type of motivation desire the achievement of a task or goal itself, and not necessarily because of the reward that’s attached. For example, an entrepreneur might build a business for the goal of building a world-class organization, and not necessarily because there’s money involved.
If you’re driven by achievement motivation, you are typically self-motivated and process-oriented, meaning that you value the process of getting better more than the end result itself. While the achievement of a goal might seem like an external reward, in actuality this type of motivation is largely internal. This is because you aren’t enamored by the glitz and glamour of a reward like money, but rather the feeling of accomplishment you get when you complete a worthy task.</dd>
<dt>Creative Motivation</dt>
<dd>-Many people are motivated by creativity or the innate drive for creative expression. When you’re motivated by the desire to express yourself, you are tapping into creative motivation. Examples of creative motivation include things in which you feel compelled to create, such as the motivation to write a book, act in a movie, play the guitar, build a product, or start a business.
Creative motivation typically manifests itself as an internal feeling that you have something to say that needs to get out. Whether you want the entire world to see your art or just a few people, anything you create in an attempt at self-expression is driven by creative motivation. While the things you create can be tangible they can also be intangible or ephemeral.</dd>
<dt>Competence & Learning Motivation</dt>
<dd>-Competence motivation, also known as learning motivation, states that people are motivated more by the process itself rather than by the reward at the end. The reason is that people who are motivated by competence motivation are literally motivated by the act of learning or getting better as they move towards the completion of a goal or task instead of the destination itself.
For example, if you want a promotion because you’ll learn valuable skills and not because of the higher expected salary, you’re motivated by competence or learning motivation. This is an extremely valuable motivator and should be used in almost any motivational strategy. This is because new, relevant skills are often more valuable than even money because, unlike material things, they’re assets that no one can take away from you.</dd>
