<p>In educational settings, motivation is typically taught as theories rather than actionable advice. For this reason, the best types of motivation center around actual educational motivational theories, such as the expectancy theory of motivation, the equity theory of motivation, and the arousal theory of motivation.
Luckily, if used correctly, motivational theories can become actionable and powerful motivational drivers for yourself and others.
<h1>Types of Motivation for Students:</h1>
<h3>However, if you’re instead looking for motivation as a student or looking for a way to motivate your students, then academic motivational theories won’t be right for you. You’ll instead want to leverage the specific types of internal and external motivators below.</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Incentive Motivation</dt>
  <dd>- Incentive motivation, unlike achievement motivation, says that people are motivated more by the reward than by the achievement of the goal itself. Instead of being motivated by the pursuit of a task, those who are motivated by incentives are driven to take action because of an expected (and often specific) reward. For example, if you want a promotion because of the higher salary and not because the new responsibility makes you feel fulfilled, you are motivated by incentives over achievement.
However, incentive motivation isn’t a bad thing. In fact, while it seems like the opposite of achievement motivation, the two can actually be used together. For example, if you want a promotion, you can be motivated both by the higher salary as well as the more complex and fulfilling work. In scenarios like this, it’s a win-win, because you are externally rewarded as well as internally fulfilled. Seek goals or tasks that have incentives as well as elements of achievement motivation.</dd>
  
<dt>Achievement Motivation</dt>
  <dd>- 
Achievement motivation states that people are driven by the desire to pursue and achieve specific goals. People who are driven by this type of motivation desire the achievement of a task or goal itself, and not necessarily because of the reward that’s attached. For example, an entrepreneur might build a business for the goal of building a world-class organization, and not necessarily because there’s money involved.
If you’re driven by achievement motivation, you are typically self-motivated and process-oriented, meaning that you value the process of getting better more than the end result itself. While the achievement of a goal might seem like an external reward, in actuality this type of motivation is largely internal. This is because you aren’t enamored by the glitz and glamour of a reward like money, but rather the feeling of accomplishment you get when you complete a worthy task.</dd>
<dt>Creative Motivation</dt>
<dd>-Many people are motivated by creativity or the innate drive for creative expression. When you’re motivated by the desire to express yourself, you are tapping into creative motivation. Examples of creative motivation include things in which you feel compelled to create, such as the motivation to write a book, act in a movie, play the guitar, build a product, or start a business.
Creative motivation typically manifests itself as an internal feeling that you have something to say that needs to get out. Whether you want the entire world to see your art or just a few people, anything you create in an attempt at self-expression is driven by creative motivation. While the things you create can be tangible they can also be intangible or ephemeral.</dd>
<dt>Competence & Learning Motivation</dt>
<dd>-Competence motivation, also known as learning motivation, states that people are motivated more by the process itself rather than by the reward at the end. The reason is that people who are motivated by competence motivation are literally motivated by the act of learning or getting better as they move towards the completion of a goal or task instead of the destination itself.
For example, if you want a promotion because you’ll learn valuable skills and not because of the higher expected salary, you’re motivated by competence or learning motivation. This is an extremely valuable motivator and should be used in almost any motivational strategy. This is because new, relevant skills are often more valuable than even money because, unlike material things, they’re assets that no one can take away from you.</dd>
