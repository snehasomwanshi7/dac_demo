<p>Similar to education, psychology and psychologists are most interested in the theories behind motivation rather than actionable advice or applied science. This is why most psychological theories are taught in education. Theories like the expectancy theory of motivation, the equity theory of motivation, and the arousal theory of motivation are the most applicable to psychology.</p>
<h1>Physiological Motivation:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Psychologists define motivation as the process by which activities are started, directed, and sustained so that certain needs are met.</li>
 <li>Needs can be psychological (for example, needing validation) or physical (for example, needing food).</li>
<li>The idea is that motivation is what guides us to accomplish a goal.</li>
</ul>
 <br> <br>
</p>Often, humans are driven by some internal force beyond their explanation. For example, this is sometimes the case when you pursue someone out of love. Your actions are motivated by deep physiological feelings that are primal and cannot be ignored, regardless of how hard we try. This represents the physiological motivational factors that are both internal and outside of our control.
Consider Maslow’s Heirarchy of Needs. All humans are motivated by basic needs such as food and shelter, as well as higher-level psychological needs and self-fulfillment. These needs are innate in all of us and we are internally-motivated to achieve them at all costs, making it helpful when trying to understand the thought process of yourself or others.</p>
