4)Why isn't possible to see the first  five rows of a table?
--> In DBMS data stored sequentially in file,where as in RDBMS table is not a file,every row is file.
-   Rows of table are scattered all over the DB server HD.
-   When you insert into table,wherever system finds the free space in the DB server HD it will stored row then.
-   The reason that RDBMS does this is to speed up the insert statement.
-   When you select table,the order of rows in the output depends on the row address.
